# ✅ LeetCode → GitHub Workflow (Follow This Every Time)

This file is your **no-thinking, copy‑paste‑and‑execute workflow**.

If you follow this for 7 days straight, your hands will learn it automatically.

---

## 🧠 ONE RULE (READ THIS FIRST)

> **GitHub only uploads files that exist inside your local repo folder.**

LeetCode website ≠ GitHub.

You must create a file on your Mac first.

---

# 🔁 THE FULL FLOW (HIGH LEVEL)

```
Solve on LeetCode
↓
Copy accepted solution
↓
Create file in local repo
↓
Paste solution into template
↓
git add → commit → push
```

---

# ✅ STEP‑BY‑STEP (DO NOT SKIP)

---

## STEP 0 — Solve on LeetCode

• Solve the problem on the LeetCode website
• Copy your **final accepted solution**

---

## STEP 1 — Open Terminal and go to repo

```bash
cd ~/neetgod
```

Confirm:

```bash
ls
```

You should see folders like:

```
strings
arrays
hashmap
```

If not → you are in the wrong folder.

---

## STEP 2 — Create the file

Choose the correct category.

Example: strings

```bash
touch strings/lc_387_first_unique_character.py
```

✅ This creates the file on your Mac.

---

## STEP 3 — Open file in VS Code

```bash
code strings/lc_387_first_unique_character.py
```

VS Code opens the file.

---

## STEP 4 — Paste template + solution

Paste this structure (modify content as needed):

```python
"""
LeetCode 387 — First Unique Character in a String
Difficulty: Easy

Patterns: hashmap, frequency, two-pass

Recognition:
- "first" → order matters
- "non-repeating" → counting

Key Idea:
- Count character frequency
- Scan again to preserve order

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
"""

from collections import defaultdict


class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = defaultdict(int)

        for c in s:
            count[c] += 1

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if count[c] == 1:
                return i

        return -1
```

Save the file.

---

## STEP 5 — Check Git status

```bash
git status
```

You should see:

```
new file: strings/lc_387_first_unique_character.py
```

This is GOOD.

---

## STEP 6 — Stage changes

```bash
git add .
```

---

## STEP 7 — Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Add LC 387"
```

---

## STEP 8 — Push to GitHub

```bash
git push
```

✅ DONE.

Your solution now lives permanently in GitHub.

---

# 🧠 THE MUSCLE‑MEMORY LOOP

Memorize this:

```
solve
copy
cd repo
touch file
code file
paste
save
git add .
git commit
git push
```

No variations.
No improvising.

---

# 🚫 DO NOT DO THESE

❌ Do not create files in Finder
❌ Do not use TextEdit or Notes
❌ Do not save on Desktop
❌ Do not drag files into repo

Everything must be created **inside the repo folder**.

---

# 🎯 GOAL

After 7 days of repetition:

• Terminal feels automatic
• Git commands feel mechanical
• LeetCode → GitHub takes < 2 minutes
• No confusion, no panic

This is how real engineers build workflow confidence.

---

✅ Follow this exactly.

No thinking required.
