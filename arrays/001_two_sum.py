""" LeetCode 1 - Two Sum Category: Arrays Difficulty: Easy Approach: - Use a hashmap to store seen values and their indices - For each number, check if target - number exists Time Complexity: O(n) Space Complexity: O(n) Edge Cases: - No valid pair (problem guarantees one) """ class Solution: def twoSum(self, nums, target): seen = {} for i, n in enumerate(nums): if target - n in seen: return [seen[target - n], i] seen[n] = i
